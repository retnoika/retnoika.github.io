      <description>Have you ever heard or read a question like this before? I’ve read and heard this hundred times. Instead of getting tired of it, I try to seek for the answer. I read a lot of books and articles of Billionaires out there. You name it! Bill Gates, Richard Branson, Warren Buffett, Ray Dalio, etc. And I do it for myself!
Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m also one of those people who have such questions, just like other people out there who want to have more money for themselves.</description>

      <description>Do you still remember when you were a child and asked: “What do you want to be when you grow up?” What were your answers? It’s probably “Astronaut!” or “Doctor!” or “Architect!” or even “Soldier!” and you answered with full excitement, right?
Mine: “… Architects (maybe)” 😆
Yes. The truth was, I never knew what kind of career I’d like to have when I grow up. I thought, be an architect is pretty awesome.</description>
