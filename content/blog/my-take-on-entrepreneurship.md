Do you still remember when you were a child and asked: “What do you want to be when you grow up?” What were your answers? It’s probably “Astronaut!” or “Doctor!” or “Architect!” or even “Soldier!” and you answered with full excitement, right?

Mine: “… Architects (maybe)” 😆

Yes. The truth was, I never knew what kind of career I’d like to have when I grow up. I thought, be an architect is pretty awesome. I like to build things, though. My dad taught me how to do men’s job in the garage—like changing the car’s tires, or even built a tree house! I was always taught to be strong and independent with his pretty strict rules. But he was an awesome man, too. So I’d never complained. Ever.
